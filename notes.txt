ðŸ˜ƒ Me: hi, i have a python script providing a chatbot that interfaces OpenAI's
GPT API.  it's supposed to keep an accumulating history of the messages
exchanged in the messages list.  but for reasons I can't track down (can you
help?), it occasionally "forgets" its history, for which i *think* (but am not
sure) that it drops entries from the messages list.  however that might not be
what's happening - I suppose also upon submission somehow the messages get lost
- but the key is that it only happens sometimes not always, in fact I think it's
  often when inserting a webpage url happens.  anyway, can you see why sometimes
the message history gets lost?  here's my python script:

ðŸ¤– GPT: The issue you're experiencing might be due to the way the messages list
is being handled. In your generate_response function, you're appending new
messages to the messages list. However, if an exception occurs during the
submit_to_gpt function, the function returns an empty string and the messages
list is not updated with  the assistant's response. This could potentially cause
the chat history to be lost or become inconsistent.                                                                        

One way to address this issue could be to ensure that the messages list is
updated in the generate_response function only after a successful API call. This
would ensure that the messages list always contains the complete history of the
conversation.                                                                                                           

Also, it's worth noting that the OpenAI API has a maximum token limit (4096
tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo and 40960 for gpt-4). If a conversation exceeds this
limit, you'll need to   truncate, omit, or otherwise reduce your text until it
fits. If the conversation history becomes too long and is truncated, this could
also give the appearance of the bot "forgetting" its history.                                                                                                                                                         

Lastly, if the issue seems to occur when inserting a webpage URL, it might be
related to the get_url_contents function. If an exception occurs while trying to
retrieve the webpage contents, the skip_input flag is set to True and the input
is not processed further. This could potentially cause some messages to be lost.
You might want to add some additional error handling or logging here to help
debug this issue.  [319 completion-tokens just for this response...]



[just noting I have since found it doesn't only happen when submitting url's,
 also without submitting url's, but all these suggestions seem helpful...]
