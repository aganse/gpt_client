Me:
I'd like you to keep an eye out for when I say something relating to moving the
robotic arm, how much, and in which direction, and when you see it to respond
in the following way while continuing our conversation.  Movements consist of
direction and magnitude.  The arm movement directions are up, down, left, and/or
right, and can include combinations of those directions too.  The arm movement
magnitudes will be either 1, 2, or 3 units based on verbal references to small,
moderate, and large amounts respectively.  Write tags of the following form in
your responses, substituting "up", "down", "left", or "right" for the
"[direction]" placeholder; and substituting 1, 2, or 3 for the "[magnitude]"
placeholder: `<arm-control>[direction], [magnitude]</arm-control>`
So for example some tags you write may look like:
`<arm-control>up, 1</arm-control>` or `<arm-control>right, 2</arm-control>` etc.
And for example if I say “move the arm far to the left and up just a little bit”
then at the end of your response write:
`<arm-control>left, 3</arm-control>  <arm-control>up, 1</arm-control>`

GPT:
Of course! I'll keep an eye out for any instructions regarding the movement of
the robotic arm, including the direction and magnitude. I'll respond accordingly
and include the appropriate tags in my replies. Please go ahead and let me know
if you have any specific instructions for the arm's movement or if you have any
other questions or topics you'd like to discuss.

Me:
Great.  So for starters, let's please shift the arm to its initial position,
way to the left and way down.

GPT:
Sure, I'll move the robotic arm to its initial position. 
<arm-control>left, 3</arm-control>  <arm-control>down, 3</arm-control>
The arm is now in the leftmost position and lowered to the bottom. How can I
assist you further?

Me:
Thanks.  Actually can you move it down just a tiny bit more?

GPT:
Certainly! I'll make a slight downward adjustment to the arm's position.
<arm-control>down, 1</arm-control>
The arm has been moved down by a small amount. Let me know if there's anything
else you'd like me to do with the arm or if you have any other questions.

Me:
Good.  Ok, now move it right some, up some, right some, up some, and then way
to the left.

GPT:
Understood! I'll perform the series of movements you described. Here's the
sequence:
<arm-control>right, 2</arm-control>
<arm-control>up, 2</arm-control>
<arm-control>right, 2</arm-control>
<arm-control>up, 2</arm-control>
<arm-control>left, 3</arm-control>
The arm has completed the specified movements. Let me know if there's anything
else you'd like me to do with the arm or if you have any further instructions or
questions.

Me:
Awesome.  Now please move it way down again, and just a little bit more left.

GPT:
Certainly! I'll move the arm down to its lowermost position and make a small
leftward adjustment as per your instructions.
<arm-control>down, 3</arm-control>
<arm-control>left, 1</arm-control>
The arm is now positioned way down and slightly to the left. If there's anything
else you'd like me to do or if you have any further requests, please let me know.
